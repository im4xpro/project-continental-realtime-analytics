# Realtime Analytics: A project for Continental at OTH Regensburg

This project was developed as part of a university project and deals with the real-time monitoring of production processes. 
The aim is to detect creeping errors and anomalies in process times and identify deviations at an early stage.

In production, deviations in process times can indicate inefficient processes or potential sources of error. 
This project combines statistical methods and machine learning-based drift detection (EvidentlyAI) to identify and visualize deviations.
